# Coin Counter using Image Processing in Python 
# (Chase Capron and Mourad Deihim)

In this project, the group created a python script that is capable of taking an input image of coins with a solid background and determine the amount of coins present in the image. They achieved this by using some of the most popular python image processing libraries available for the use of filters and loading images.
